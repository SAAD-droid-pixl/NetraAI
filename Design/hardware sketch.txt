COMPONENT BREAKDOWN

1. Wide-Angle Front Camera

* Mounted at the front frame
* Captures real-world scene
* Feeds visual data to Edge AI chip
* No continuous recording by default

2. OLED Mini Projector (AR HUD)

* Projects minimal information into user’s field of view
* Low brightness, high contrast
* Only essential overlays (text, arrows, labels)

3. Edge AI Chip (Modular Brain)

* Core processing unit
* Handles:

  * Object detection
  * Scene context
  * Intent recognition
  * Prompt routing
* Modular design allows future upgrades

4. Bone-Conduction Speaker

* Mounted in temple arm
* Transfers sound through bone vibration
* Keeps ears open for environmental awareness

5. Secure Memory Module

* Stores encrypted personal context
* Local-only by default
* User-controlled data access

6. Power & Battery Unit

* Distributed along frame arms
* Optimized for balance and comfort
* Supports quick sleep / wake cycles

HYBRID PROCESSING MODEL

ON-DEVICE (Default):

* Vision understanding
* Intent detection
* Memory recall
* Fast responses

OPTIONAL CLOUD (User Approved):

* Heavy reasoning
* Model updates
* Knowledge expansion

DESIGN GOAL SUMMARY

* Lightweight form factor
* Minimal heat generation
* Privacy-first architecture
* Normal glasses feel
* Invisible, calm intelligence

This sketch represents NetraAI’s philosophy:
Technology should assist silently, not dominate the user’s attention.
