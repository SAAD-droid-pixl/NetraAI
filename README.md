> **Empowering Human Intelligence through Wearable AI.**

## 🚀 Vision

NetraAI is not just a device — it's a paradigm shift. Our goal is to build a lightweight, wearable AR-AI system that overlays human knowledge and contextual assistance directly into real-world tasks.

- Imagine a world where no one says *"मुझे यह नहीं आता..."* — because information is always just there.
- A device small enough to wear, smart enough to help, and intuitive enough to learn from you.
